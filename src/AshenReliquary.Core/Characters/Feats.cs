/// <item><see cref="Skill"/> + <see cref="Value"/>: a circumstance bonus to a skill's checks ("Lore" means any Lore,
/// "Untrained" any untrained skill).</item>
/// <item><see cref="HitPointsPerLevel"/>, <see cref="SpeedFeet"/>, <see cref="Resist"/> + <see cref="Value"/>.</item>
/// <item><see cref="Recovery"/>: out-of-combat recovery faster by this share (0.5 = half as fast again).</item>
/// <item><see cref="TaintRate"/>: Taint builds more slowly by this share.</item>
/// <item><see cref="CritDamage"/>: extra damage on a critical hit. <see cref="FuryPerHit"/>: extra Fury on each hit.</item>
/// <item><see cref="ResourceRegen"/>: Mana regenerates faster by this share.</item>
/// <item><see cref="Reach"/>: melee reach, in tiles. <see cref="SpellRange"/>: spell range, in tiles.</item>
/// <item><see cref="Ability"/>: a new ability on the bar. <see cref="ExtraMissiles"/> on <see cref="Ability"/>: one more missile.</item>
/// <item><see cref="IgnoreArmorSpeed"/>: body armour never slows the character.</item>
/// <item>An <see cref="Ability"/> with any of <see cref="Targets"/>, <see cref="Cost"/>, <see cref="Knockback"/>,
/// <see cref="Chain"/>, <see cref="Splash"/>, <see cref="Radius"/>, <see cref="OnHitSeconds"/> or
/// <see cref="WardSeconds"/> set doesn't add the ability: it changes it wherever it is on the bar (the spec's
/// "modifier" feats: one more target, 5 less Fury, a longer ward).</item>
/// <item><see cref="BlockHardness"/>: Shield Block with a shield takes this much more off a blow.
/// <see cref="BlockCounter"/>: after a Shield Block the hero strikes back at the attacker if it is in reach.</item>
/// <item>The Rogue's: <see cref="SneakDice"/> more sneak attack dice; <see cref="AmbushCrit"/>: a Strike out of hiding
/// that hits is a critical hit; <see cref="SwiftSneak"/>: no slower while hidden; <see cref="TumbleFeint"/>: enemies
/// next to a Tumble's path are left off-guard. <see cref="PersistentDice"/> on an <see cref="Ability"/>: its wound or poison
/// deals more dice.</item>
/// <item>The Ranger's: <see cref="Pierce"/> (on its own: every arrow passes through that many more enemies; on an
/// <see cref="Ability"/>: that ability's arrows do), <see cref="CritResource"/> back on a critical hit with a bow,
/// <see cref="WeaponRange"/> more tiles for a bow, <see cref="PreyDice"/> more Hunt Prey dice. <see cref="Companion"/>:
/// an animal companion (a creature id) fights beside the hero; <see cref="CompanionGrowth"/> makes it stronger.</item>
/// <item>The Champion's: <see cref="UndeadBane"/> vitality damage on Strikes against the undead; <see cref="HealShare"/>:
/// Lay on Hands heals that share more; <see cref="Light"/> tiles of light round the hero; <see cref="TaintFuel"/>: the
